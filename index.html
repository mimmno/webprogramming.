            <p>I can't go to school because of something bad, but I hope the day will come soon when the situation calms down and I can go to school. 
            In fact, one of my goals this year was to write my diary steadily, but I don't have anything to write in my diary because what I do is the same every day. 
            I hope you have a productive day soon.</p>
